## Solutions repo for [Advent of Code 2024 with Deno](https://deno.com/blog/advent-of-code-2024)

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event starting December
1st where anyone can participate and solve daily coding challenges. It's a fun
way to flex your problem solving muscles, a great chance to explore new tools
and techniques, and to learn from others. In that spirit, this year we warmly
invite you to give Deno a try as you join in the problem-solving fun.
[Deno](https://deno.com/) is a great tool for building with JavaScript and
[TypeScript](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/advanced/typescript/overview/),
offering a development pipeline we think people will love.
